<h1>The Best Movies According to Ben</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I'm a sucker for good animation.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I'm a huge Batman fan and this is probably the best version of him i've seen.</p>
<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>Who doesn't like a disaster movie? Great effects for the time and a competent story</p>
